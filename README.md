# Nano_Identation
Predicts nanoindentation depth using CatBoost regression based on laser pulse duration, energy, loading rate, load, and time. The Streamlit app takes inputs and shows real-time depth predictions, aiding material scientists in analyzing material deformation without extensive physical tests.
